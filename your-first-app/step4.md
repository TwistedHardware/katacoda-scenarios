# Running your application

Before we run the application, let's compile it. Run this in the terminal:

`go build`{{execute}}

Let's run our app. Run this on the terminal:

`./todo`{{execute}}

Great, you have your first application up and running. To access it click on the + sign in the bottom terminal and select "Select port to view on Client 1"

Then type "8080" and click "Display Port".

Awesome! that was it. It is this simple to create web apps in uAdmin.
