# Preparing you Application

Your application required some setup to work properly, like having access to HTML temaples and static files (javascripts and CSS).

We made this easy for you by running a single command that prepares your a folder to be your next great project. Tun this command in terminal:

`uadmin prepare`{{execute}}

Notice that you have created these folders:

 - api
 - media
 - models
 - static
 - templates
 - views

 Now let's create a golang file to start coding. Run this in terminal:

 `touch main.go`{{execute}}

 Great, next we will start coding.
